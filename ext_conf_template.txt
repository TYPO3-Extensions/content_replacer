# cat=basic/; type=options[normal=normal, strictWithFallback=strictWithFallback, strict=strict]; label=Language Fallback Modus: The normal option causes the extension to use your global TYPO3 language settings. You can select strict to ignore them totally and to require a translation. The strictWithFallback option isn't such conservative and fallbacks to the default one if no translation is available.
sysLanguageMode = normal

# cat=basic/enable; type=boolean; label=Call Always the Find/Replace Method Before Output: Enable this setting to call the find/replace method always before the final output. It's independent from the cache or no_cache state of this page!
